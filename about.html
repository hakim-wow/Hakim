<p>My name is Mohamad Hakim Ikhwan bin Mohamad Hashim. I am 20 years old and come from the beautiful town of Kuantan, Pahang. I am the fifth of six children in my family, which has taught me the importance of understanding and collaboration in a household. Currently, I am pursuing my diploma in Information Management at UITM Segamat. This field fascinates me because of its dynamic nature and its potential to influence and organize the vast amount of information that shapes our world.I consider myself a highly motivated person who dreams big and works tirelessly to turn those dreams into reality. Every day, I strive to improve myself and overcome any challenges that come my way. I live by the words of Lionel Messi: *"You have to fight to achieve your dreams. You have to sacrifice and work hard for it."* This quote has become a mantra that keeps me grounded and encourages me to push through difficulties while reminding me that success comes with dedication and effort. Through perseverance and a strong belief in my goals, I aim to make a meaningful impact in my field and inspire others to pursue their aspirations with the same passion and determination.</p>
