<p>From July 21 to September 12, 2024, I had the privilege of working as an Industrial Trainee in the IT sector, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in various domains of system administration and technical support. My primary responsibilities included providing technical assistance to employees by troubleshooting hardware and software issues, resolving network connectivity problems, and performing critical tasks such as password resets to ensure uninterrupted access to systems. I also played a key role in monitoring system performance, managing user accounts, and creating system backups to maintain operational efficiency. Additionally, I contributed to General IT Support by diagnosing and resolving issues with IT equipment such as computers and printers, assisting with software installations, and conducting regular maintenance checks to ensure optimal functionality. My experience also involved monitoring network performance, addressing connectivity issues, and maintaining accurate network documentation for future reference. This internship helped me strengthen my problem-solving, communication, and technical skills while deepening my understanding of operating systems like Windows and macOS, as well as best practices in system administration and IT security.</p>
